# README for median-android

## Motivation

This is an Android mobile client that interacts with a simple web application. It was built for a prospective employer to demonstrate simple interactions with a RESTful web service ([median-price-rails](https://github.com/egarson/median-price-rails)).

The point of this project was to get my Android feet wet; as this is part of a pedagogical exercise, the scope of it is quite limited.

Please see the README for [median-price-rails](https://github.com/egarson/median-price-rails) for more information.
